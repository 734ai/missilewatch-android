### üìù **Repository Description:**

An open-source Android-based framework for distributed missile launch detection using real-time acoustic analysis, GPS triangulation, and sensor fusion. This project enables mass-deployed smartphones to serve as passive early warning sensors for tracking missile launches in denied or high-risk regions. Includes Android app, backend API (Flask), and FFT-based audio classification engine.
